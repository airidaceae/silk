# Silk programming language

## Goals and philosophy
The main goal of Silk is to be a simple functional language with all the control (and hopefully speed) of C. I hope to make an easy to use low level language that gives a lot of control to the user while having quality of life features like methods and type interpolation.

## Roadmap
### MVP
- [ ] lexer
- [ ] syntax
- [ ] int-only type system
- [ ] return values
- [ ] if statements
- [ ] else statements
- [ ] else if
- [ ] while
- [ ] turing complete
- [ ] wasm

### Alpha (type system)
- [ ] pointers
- [ ] memory mangement
  - [ ] calloc
  - [ ] realloc
- [ ] structs
- [ ] strings
- [ ] floats
- [ ] chars
- [ ] enums
- [ ] type interpolation 

### Beta (polish + features) 
- [ ] methods
- [ ] modules
